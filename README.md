### HTML/CSS/JS

Visual Studio Code provides basic support for HTML, CSS, and JS programming out of the box. There is syntax highlighting, smart completions with IntelliSense, and customizable formatting.

However, to make your life easier download HTML and CSS support for VS Code lots of increased functionality, I provide a link but it will be easier to get the plugin from the plugin menu inside the VS Code application on your computer.
